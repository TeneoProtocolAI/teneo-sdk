```bash
npx tsx examples/usage/02-list-agents.ts
```

**What you'll learn**:

   ID: x-agent-001
   Status: online
   Capabilities: social-media, twitter
   ...
```

---

### 3. Pick Specific Agent

**File**: `03-pick-agent.ts`

Find and communicate with a specific agent.

```bash
# Pick by name
npx tsx examples/usage/03-pick-agent.ts "X Platform Agent"

# Or let it auto-select
npx tsx examples/usage/03-pick-agent.ts
```

**What you'll learn**:
- Finding agents by ID or name
- Sending direct commands to agents
- Waiting for responses with timeout
- Handling both humanized and raw responses
- Response metadata (task ID, duration, etc.)

**Output**:
```
✅ Selected: X Platform Agent
⚙️  Sending command to agent...
   Command: timeline @elonmusk 3
   Waiting for response...
✅ Response received!
📝 Humanized Response: [response content]
```

---

### 4. Find by Capability

**File**: `04-find-by-capability.ts`

Use the SDK's indexed search for efficient agent discovery.

```bash
npx tsx examples/usage/04-find-by-capability.ts
```

**What you'll learn**:
- **PERF-3**: O(1) capability lookups
- O(1) status lookups (online/offline)
- O(k) name-based token search
- Performance comparison
- Practical agent selection strategies

**Output**:
```
🔍 Searching for capability: "weather-forecast"
✅ Found 2 agent(s) (0.123ms):
   • Weather Agent
   • Climate Data Agent

📊 Performance Summary:
   • Capability search: O(1) - constant time
   • Status search: O(1) - constant time
```

---

### 5. Webhook Integration

**File**: `05-webhook-example.ts`

Set up HTTP webhooks to receive SDK events.

```bash
npx tsx examples/usage/05-webhook-example.ts
```

### 6. Simple API Server

**File**: `06-simple-api-server.ts`

Build a REST API that wraps the Teneo SDK.

```bash
npx tsx examples/usage/06-simple-api-server.ts
```

Then test with curl:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# List agents
curl http://localhost:3000/agents

# Send message
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"hello","waitForResponse":true}'

# Find by capability
curl http://localhost:3000/agents/capability/weather-forecast
```

**What you'll learn**:
- Building Express REST API
- Wrapping SDK in HTTP endpoints
- Error handling patterns
- Health monitoring
- Production-ready server design

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /health` - Server and SDK health
- `GET /agents` - List all agents
- `GET /agents/:id` - Get specific agent
- `GET /agents/capability/:capability` - Find by capability
- `POST /message` - Send message to agent
- `GET /rooms` - List rooms
- `POST /rooms/:roomId/subscribe` - Subscribe to room

## 🎯 Learning Path

We recommend following this learning path:

1. **Start with 01-connect.ts** to understand basic setup
2. **Try 02-list-agents.ts** to explore the agent registry
3. **Run 03-pick-agent.ts** to learn agent communication
4. **Explore 04-find-by-capability.ts** for efficient search
5. **Set up 05-webhook-example.ts** for event notifications
6. **Build 06-simple-api-server.ts** for production patterns
7. **Monitor with 07-event-listener.ts** for observability

## 🔧 Common Patterns

### Understanding Message Routing

The SDK supports two routing approaches depending on your environment:

**Coordinator Environments:**
- Natural language messages work: `"Get bitcoin info"`
- Coordinator automatically selects the best agent
- Direct commands also work for explicit agent selection

**Non-Coordinator Environments:**
- Must use direct command syntax: `"@Agent Name command params"`
- Example: `"@X Platform Agent search bitcoin 5"`
- Required for all messages in these environments

### Pattern 1: Basic Message Flow

```typescript
const sdk = new TeneoSDK(config);
await sdk.connect();

// Send and wait for response
const response = await sdk.sendMessage('hello', {
  room: roomId,
  waitForResponse: true,
  timeout: 30000
});

console.log(response.humanized);
```

### Pattern 2: Direct Agent Command

Direct commands work in all environments and are **required** in non-coordinator environments.

```typescript
// Find agent by capability
const agents = sdk.findAvailableAgentsByCapability('weather');
const weatherAgent = agents[0];

// Option 1: Use @mention syntax (recommended)
const response = await sdk.sendMessage('@Weather Agent forecast for NYC', {
  room: roomId,
  waitForResponse: true
});

// Option 2: Use sendDirectCommand
const response = await sdk.sendDirectCommand({
  agent: weatherAgent.name, // Use full agent name
  command: 'forecast for NYC',
  room: roomId
}, true);
```

**When to use:**
- **Required** in non-coordinator environments
- **Optional** in coordinator environments (explicit agent selection)

### Pattern 3: Event-Driven

```typescript
sdk.on('agent:response', (response) => {
  console.log('Response:', response.humanized);
  // Process response asynchronously
});

// Fire and forget
await sdk.sendMessage('hello', { room: roomId });
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "PRIVATE_KEY is required"

Set the environment variable:
```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

### "No agents available"

Wait a bit longer after connecting:
```typescript
await sdk.connect();
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000)); // Wait 2s
```

### "Webhook delivery failed"

Ensure your webhook URL is accessible:
- Use `http://localhost:PORT` for local testing
- Use HTTPS for production webhooks
- Check firewall settings

### "Connection timeout"

Check your WebSocket URL and network:
```typescript
const config = new SDKConfigBuilder()
  .withWebSocketUrl('wss://correct-url.com/ws')
  .withReconnection({ enabled: true, maxAttempts: 10 })
  .build();
```

## 📚 Next Steps

After completing these examples, check out:

- **[Production Dashboard](../production-dashboard/)** - Full-featured monitoring UI
- **[API Documentation](../../docs/)** - Complete API reference
- **[Main README](../../README.md)** - Full SDK documentation

## 💡 Tips

1. **Always build the SDK first**: Run `npm run build` before running examples
2. **Use environment variables**: Don't hardcode credentials
3. **Enable debug logging**: Set `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for troubleshooting
4. **Check health status**: Use `sdk.getHealth()` to monitor SDK state
5. **Handle errors**: Always use try-catch blocks in production code
